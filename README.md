[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gitterHQ/autolink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gitterHQ/autolink) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/autolink.png)](https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/autolink)
-------------------------------

Autolink is a tiny library for finding hypertext links in your text nodes in your DOM and turning them into clickable links.

It's primary focus is on manipulating the DOM instead of manipulating markup, in order to avoid potential XSS leaks.

-------------------------------

# Using

Add `bin/autolink.js` to your project. It also supports AMD modules if thats your bag.

```
/* Somewhere in your code is a refernece to an HTMLElement like this */
var el.innerHTML = 'hello www.gitter.im world';

/* Simply call autolink and anchor tags will be created */
autolink(el);
```

# Building

```
npm install
wake
npm test
```
